# Changes made:

# 1. Renamed the function from `plus` to `bitwise_addition` for clarity.
# 2. Combined the two calls to `plus(a, b)` into a single variable (`result`) to avoid redundant calculations.
# 3. Moved the comparison with `k` into a separate `if` block for better readability.
# 4. Added a `main` function for better structure and reusability.
# 5. Used f-strings for formatting the output string.
