# Changes made:

# 1. Extracted the logic for creating a roadmap into a separate function `create_roadmap` for reusability.
# 2. Used `elif` statements for better readability in the plan conditions.
# 3. Moved the initialization of `roadmap` inside the `while` loop to ensure a new roadmap is created for each iteration.
# 4. Added a `main` function for better structure and reusability.
